                <p>
                    I am a programmer from the great state of Minnesota.  Born and raised local, I first cut my teeth on coding back when I was in highschool working with languages like Java and Alice, similar to Scratch.
                    When I later moved on to college I moved around between majors before deciding on Computer Science.  We learned a great many things in the program, from recursive programming in Scheme, to client server
                     applications, and even analysis of program run times and sort methods in our Algorithms and Data Structures Class.  That great time in my life changed dramatically when I was forced to take medical leave
                     at the end of my Senior year.  Now though, I'm fit as a fiddle and ready to hit the ground running in what ever project comes my way.  I should mention the great equalizer of coding is that no matter how 
                     many times you need to take a crack at it eventually it'll let you on.  And getting back in that saddle has never felt so easy with the experts in my life I've surrounded myself with.
                    
                    I'd also like to take this time to express some of my other interests in my life.  They include things like board games with friends.  Making trips out to Wisconsin to see them.  Spending time with my family, 
                    both my brother's and my folks, and not an entirely too small passion for skiing.  One of my favorite past times for half the year, and one I've enjoyed mastering since I was about 8.  There are plenty more
                    things to click on and explore on these pages, but I'll let you explore them on your own time.  Know that I'll be glad to talk you through them while you journey through my Profile!
